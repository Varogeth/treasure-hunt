# Treasure Room

You decide to take the left path again and it serves you well! You reach the end of the cave and discover the long-lost treasure! A chest lies before you. Anxiously, you open it up; revealing a handsome sum of gold doubloons! Congratulations! You can afford to retire now!

Thanks for playing my silly, little gamebook!
